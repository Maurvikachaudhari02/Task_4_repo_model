# Task-4 — Spam Detection (CODTECH Internship)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a spam vs ham classifier using scikit-learn.

## Files
- `task4_ml_model.ipynb` — notebook with code and results
- `spam_classifier_pipeline.joblib` — saved trained pipeline
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run
1. Open `task4_ml_model.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells step by step (or use "Run All").
3. The trained model will be saved as `spam_classifier_pipeline.joblib`.
4. Use the saved model to make predictions on new text messages.
